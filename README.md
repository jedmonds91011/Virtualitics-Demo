# Virtualitics Demo

This repository contains a Unity 5.6.0 project along with a 'demo.apk' file. The goal of the project was to import the iris-data set located in the 'Resources' folder. Once the data was imported the program instantiates colored spheres at particular locations and size based on the imported data values.
